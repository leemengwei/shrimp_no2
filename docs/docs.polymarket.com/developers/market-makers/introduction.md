# Market Maker Introduction

> Overview of market making on Polymarket and available tools for liquidity providers

## What is a Market Maker?

A Market Maker (MM) on Polymarket is a sophisticated trader who provides liquidity to prediction markets by continuously posting bid and ask orders. By "laying the spread," market makers enable other users to trade efficiently while earning the spread as compensation for the risk they take.

Market makers are essential to Polymarket's ecosystem:

* **Provide liquidity** across all markets
* **Tighten spreads** for better user experience
* **Enable price discovery** through continuous quoting
* **Absorb trading flow** from retail and institutional users

**Not a Market Maker?** If you're building an application that routes orders for your
users, see the [Builders Program](/developers/builders/builder-intro) instead. Builders
get access to gasless transactions via the Relayer Client.

## Getting Started

To become a market maker on Polymarket:

1. **Complete setup** - Deploy wallets, fund with USDCe, set token approvals
2. **Connect to data feeds** - WebSocket for orderbook, RTDS for low-latency data
3. **Start quoting** - Post orders via CLOB REST API
